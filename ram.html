            <h1>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h1>
            <p>Random Access Memory, or RAM, is a type of computer memory that is used to store data and machine code currently being used and processed by a computer. It provides high-speed data access to the CPU and plays a critical role in overall system performance.</p>

            <h2>Key Features:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Volatile Memory:</strong> RAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses its stored information when the power is turned off. It is used for temporary storage during active computing tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> RAM is much faster than storage devices like hard drives or SSDs, allowing the CPU to quickly access and retrieve data needed for active processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> RAM capacity is measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB). Systems with larger RAM capacities can handle more simultaneous tasks and run memory-intensive applications smoothly.</li>
                <li><strong>DDR Types:</strong> RAM comes in various DDR (Double Data Rate) types, such as DDR4 and DDR5, with each generation offering improvements in speed and efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Channel Configurations:</strong> Some systems support multi-channel configurations, where RAM modules work in tandem to enhance data transfer rates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Usage:</h2>
            <p>RAM is used by the operating system and applications to temporarily store data that is actively being used or processed. It allows for quick access to frequently used information, reducing the need to retrieve data from slower storage devices.</p>

            <h2>Choosing the Right RAM:</h2>
            <p>When choosing RAM for a computer, factors such as the system's motherboard compatibility, supported DDR type, and desired capacity should be considered. For gaming and resource-intensive applications, having ample and high-speed RAM is crucial for optimal performance.</p>

            <h1>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h1>
            <p>The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It is a crucial component responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations that drive the overall functionality of a computer system.</p>
    
            <h2>Key Features:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Processing Power:</strong> CPUs are designed to handle a wide range of tasks, from simple arithmetic operations to complex calculations required by software applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Clock Speed:</strong> Measured in gigahertz (GHz), the clock speed represents the number of instructions a CPU can execute in a second. Higher clock speeds generally result in faster processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Cores:</strong> Modern CPUs often have multiple cores, allowing them to handle parallel processing and execute multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing overall performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache:</strong> CPU cache is high-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data, reducing the time it takes for the CPU to retrieve information.</li>
                <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> The architecture of a CPU, such as x86 or ARM, determines its compatibility with software and the overall performance it can achieve.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Usage:</h2>
            <p>CPU plays a vital role in various computing tasks, including running operating systems, executing software applications, and handling complex calculations in fields like graphics rendering, scientific simulations, and more.</p>
    
            <h2>Choosing the Right CPU:</h2>
            <p>When building or upgrading a computer, selecting the right CPU is crucial to meet specific performance requirements. Factors such as intended use, budget, and compatibility with other hardware components should be considered.</p>

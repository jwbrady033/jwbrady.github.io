            <h1>PSU (Power Supply Unit)</h1>
            <p>The Power Supply Unit (PSU) is a critical component of a computer system responsible for converting electrical power from an outlet into a form that can be used by the computer's internal components. It provides the necessary power to run the various hardware components within a computer.</p>

            <h2>Key Features:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Power Output:</strong> PSUs come in different wattage ratings, and the power output should be sufficient to meet the needs of the components in the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Modular PSUs allow users to connect only the cables needed, reducing clutter and improving airflow within the computer case.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> PSU efficiency is measured by the 80 PLUS rating. Higher efficiency ratings indicate less wasted energy and lower operating costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Connectors:</strong> PSUs come with various connectors to power components such as the motherboard, CPU, graphics card, and storage devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Form Factor:</strong> PSUs come in different form factors, such as ATX and SFX, to fit various computer case sizes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Choosing the Right PSU:</h2>
            <p>When selecting a PSU, it's essential to consider the power requirements of the components in the system, future upgrades, and the overall build's form factor. Ensuring compatibility and providing sufficient power are crucial for stable and reliable system performance.</p>
